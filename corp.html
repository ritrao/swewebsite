                                <h3>SHE-SWE-MEET Engineering & Computer Science Career Fair</h3>
                                <p>Every year we partner up with other Rutgers engineering minority societies (the Minority Engineering Educational Task and the Society of Hispanic Engineers) to host the annual SHE-SWE-MEET Engineering and Computer Science Career Fair, the largest student-run career fair on the engineering campus. This event connects Rutgers engineering students to top employers to further their career efforts. With over 50 companies and hundreds of students attending the career fair every year, Rutgers SWE has been recognized several times in our region and university for coordinating an event that aligns best with SWE's strategic and professional goals. If you are interested in bringing your company to the SHE-SWE-MEET Engineering and Computer Science Career Fair, please contact our  External Vice President at <a href="mailto:ru.swe.evp@gmail.com">ru.swe.evp@gmail.com</a> for more information! </p>
